# mapstats.tf

Mapstats.tf is a soon-to-be website that will host in-depth stats for competitive Team Fortress 2, specifically pertaining to maps. Inspired by existing stats websites for the game such as more.tf and logs.tf, I wanted to make a similar site hosting statistical breakdowns in top TF2 leagues pertaining specifically to maps, as there is little such information out there at the moment.

The target audience of the website is for experienced Team Fortress 2 players who are familiar with playing the Highlander game format in a league system. Players and league administrators should be able to use mapstats.tf to provoke thoughtful discussion on how to improve strategies and map selections.

I began development of the project in late January of 2023 using HTML and CSS. I drew sketches of how I'd like the pages to appear, partially inspired by more.tf's layout, though I sought to make something my own. Next, I consulted materials such as w3schools and Mozilla's MDN docs to familiarize myself with various features. I primarily used Firefox to debug, but I did do a cursory click-around in Chrome to see if there were bugs.

## Running mapstats.tf
To run mapstats.tf, simply unpack the zip file and open any one of the .html files. I suggest starting with index.html as it is the intended homepage.
